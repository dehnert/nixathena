# Nixathena

This is Nixathena, a vague start at a package repo for using MIT Athena on [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), inspired by [Debathena](https://debathena.mit.edu/).

Eventually I may [add it](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR#how-to-add-your-own-repository) as a [Nix User Repository](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) (and have used that template), but I don't think it's stable enough for that yet.
